Hello! My name is Kayla Pins and I am a high school health teacher in rural Iowa. I live in Monticello with my husband, our five-month-old son, and our two dogs. 
I made a website for myself as a sixth grader to share files for my favorite computer game. In high school I made a website, <a href="http://makinglearningfun.com/">Making Learning Fun</a>, for my mom to share early childhood printables. Other than that I have made several Wordpress blogs.
I am self-taught so I expect for this course to teach me the right way to code and to give me the skills and terminology to continue to learn. With my new skills I would like to create a nice portfolio website for myself to eventually seek work remotely as an instructional designer.
In my free time I enjoy hiking, needlework, and reading.
